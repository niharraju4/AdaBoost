# Travel Data Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing travel data to predict whether a customer will purchase a travel product. The dataset includes various features such as age,
gender, marital status, monthly income, and more. The analysis involves data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Travel.csv`. It contains various features related to travel customers. The dataset is loaded and explored using pandas.

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involves the following steps:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Identify and fill missing values using median or mode.
2. **Correcting Categories**: Fix any inconsistencies in categorical data.
3. **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**: Remove columns that are not useful for modeling.
4. **Creating New Features**: Generate new features that might be useful for prediction.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves identifying numerical, categorical, discrete, and continuous features. Preprocessing steps include scaling numerical features and one-hot encoding categorical features.

## Model Training

Several regression models are trained and evaluated, including:

- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- K-Neighbors Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- AdaBoost Regressor

The models are evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2 score.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using `RandomizedSearchCV` for RandomForestClassifier and AdaBoostClassifier to find the best parameters.

## Evaluation

The performance of the models is evaluated on both training and testing sets. The best model is selected based on the evaluation metrics.

## ROC AUC Curve

The ROC AUC curve is plotted for the AdaBoostClassifier to visualize its performance.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
